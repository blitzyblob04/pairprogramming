							<h2>Other Reference Definition</h1>
							<section style="font-family: 'Permanent Marker', cursive;">Pair programming consists of two programmers sharing a single workstation (one screen, keyboard and mouse among the pair). The programmer at the keyboard is usually called the “driver”, the other, also actively involved in the programming task but focusing more on overall direction is the “navigator”; it is expected that the programmers swap roles every few minutes or so.

				<h2>Overview of the Topic</h2>
				<p style="font-size: 30px;">Developers do their best work when they’re inspired and empowered, as we discussed recently in this post. That means equipping your developers with the tools and resources they need to be more efficient, blending agility with accuracy to build better products, faster. There are several tactics for achieving these goals, many of which work well in tandem. Application performance monitoring, for instance, helps you take a proactive approach to monitoring rather than responding to issues only after they’ve reached your users. Another method for boosting efficiency is pair programming, Let’s take a look at pair programming advantages, concept, and challenges of pair programming.</p>

						<h2>Pair Programming Advantages</h2>
						<h3>There are several compelling reasons you should consider this strategy:</h3>
							<p class="fragment">1. Two heads are better than one. If the driver encounters a hitch with the code, there will be two of them who’ll solve the problem.</p>
							<p class="fragment">2. More efficient since two (2) programmers are working on a single program.Studies have shown that two programmers working on the same program are only 15% slower than when these programmers work independently, rather than the presupposed 50% slow down.</p>
							<p class="fragment">3. Fewer coding mistakes. Because there is another programmer looking over your work, it results in better code. In fact, an earlier study shows that it results in 15% fewer bugs than code written by solo programmers. Plus, it allows the driver to remain focus on the code being written while the other attends to external matters or interruption.</p>

						<h2>Pair Programming Advantages</h2>
						<h3>There are several compelling reasons you should consider this strategy:</h3>
							<p class="fragment">4. An effective way to share knowledge.You can learn things better from your partner, especially in areas that may be unfamiliar to you. Developers can also pick up best practices and better techniques from more advanced programmers. It can also facilitate mentoring relationships between two programmers.</p>
							<p class="fragment">5. Develops your staff’s interpersonal skills. Collaborating on a single project helps your team to appreciate the value of communication and teamwork.</p>

					<h2>How to Effectively Pair Your Programmers</h2>
					<p style="font-size: 30px;">The best way to approach pairing is to partner two programmers and have them share a computer. Make them work together to architect, code and then test their codes in a genuine sense of a partnership. While the ideal setup would include two programmers who are equally skilled (expert – expert or novice – novice), you can also use pair programming for training and educational purposes <u>(expert – novice)</u>.

						The pair should be able to decide how to split the work, and it is advisable that they should switch roles often.</p>

							<ol>
								<strong>1.</strong> 3 pairs of programmers for the workshop
								<br>
								2. Each pair will be given a task to a create a part of the website: <br>
								<p class="under2">
								 	a. <u>1st Pair</u> - NavBar Title Search Bar favicon <br>
									b. <u>2nd Pair</u> - Body and Its content ( About: Ulaps Introduction, Brief History, Services, Ulaps Divisions, and anything that you may want to add which is related to ulaps) <br>
									c. <u>3rd Pair</u> - will be responsible for the (Contacts Section/Comments with submit/Social Media Links/Footer). <br>
								</p>
								3. All design will depend on your ideas and perspective.
								<br>
								4. You will be given a time of maximum of 1hr30mins to finish the task.
								<br>
								5. When time is over all participants or everyone will be gathered together in a single call conference.Each of your task will put together to complete the webpage using the GitHub and by building the webpage everyone can cooperate upon building the webpage for some furnishing.
